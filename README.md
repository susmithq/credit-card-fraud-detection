# credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. It uses Logistic Regression trained on transaction data and a Streamlit web interface for real-time user input and prediction, demonstrating practical fraud detection in financial systems.

🔍 Project Description : 
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning–based application designed to identify whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.
The project uses Logistic Regression to analyze transaction patterns and make real-time predictions. A simple and interactive Streamlit web interface allows users to input transaction details and instantly view the prediction result.
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in financial security, handling real-world challenges such as imbalanced datasets and real-time prediction.
